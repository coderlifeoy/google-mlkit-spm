# Google MLKit for Swift Package Manager

> This repo is used for generate SPM support for Google MLKit lib, which currently is only available on CocoaPods.

# Instructions

## Auto from GitHub actions:
Just update `target-version.txt` and push new changes, GitHub action will run and create new release with attached xcframeworks.

View `.github/workflows/release.yml` for more information.

## Manual

### Clone repo includes submodule:

```sh
$ git clone --recurse-submodules <repo_url>
```

### Install Google MLKit pods (using bundler or global `pod`)

```sh
$ bundle install
$ (cd PodsProject && bundle exec pod install)
```

### Run script to build and create xcframeworks

```sh
$ ./scripts/create-xcframeworks.sh
```

> This script will:
> - Build source-based libs then create xcframeworks for them (GoogleToolboxForMac)
> - Use `xcframework-maker` to split prebuilt frameworks to xcframeworks (,...)
> - Compress xcframeworks as zips and generate SHA256 to use in `Package.swift`

### Create a new release
- Update `Package.swift` to change `.binaryTarget` url paths and checksums
- Create new release and attach xcframework zips to the release
- If your git hosting service does not provide release attachments, then you can upload zips somewhere and use those urls instead.
